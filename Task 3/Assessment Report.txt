Title: Password Transmitted over HTTP

Domain: zero.webappsecurity.com
Sub Domain: zero.webappsecurity.com/signin.html 

Steps to Reproduce:

Step 1: Open to http://zero.webappsecurity.com

Step 2: Go To Signin on right top

Step 3: Inspect the Form: Use your browser’s developer tools to inspect the login form. Note that the form's action attribute points to http://zero.webappsecurity.com/signin.html.

Step 5: Enter a test username and password in the login form and submit it.

Step 6: Observe Network Traffic: Use a network traffic analyzer (like Wireshark). You will see that the credentials are transmitted in plain text over HTTP.

Impact: When credentials are transmitted over HTTP, they are sent in plain text. This means that any attacker who can intercept the network traffic (e.g., via a man-in-the-middle attack) can easily read the username and password. This can lead to unauthorized access to user accounts, potentially exposing sensitive information and compromising the security of the entire application.

Mitigation: Implement HTTP Strict Transport Security (HSTS) to ensure that all connections to your website are made over HTTPS.
Ensure all internal links and form actions point to HTTPS URLs. This includes updating the login form’s action attribute to use HTTPS.
